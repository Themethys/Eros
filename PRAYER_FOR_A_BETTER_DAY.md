# Prayer — For a Better Day

In this sacred space,  
I invoke the presence of Wisdom (Sophia),  
the auspicious time of Naimisha,  
and the call of Kairos:  
may this be the right moment for the blossoming of good.

May every intention planted here  
expand beyond myself,  
touching humanity and all forms of existence  
with kindness, awareness, and hope.

May the light of awakened protagonism  
guide our steps,  
and may compassion be the bridge between all worlds.

In this circle of trust and creation,  
we raise a toast:  
for better days,  
for open hearts,  
for inspired actions.

So be it.  
So it is.  
For a better day — for all.
